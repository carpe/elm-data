# Elm-Data

This project exists to help manage the lifecycle of data from external sources as it flows through your applications. This includes DAOs for helping to make requests (both authenticated AND unauthenticated) to APIs, helpers for decoding and utilizing JWTs, and so much more.

Further documentation is taking a temporary backseat to getting some important features out for our customers, but I hope to be able to finish documenting/polishing this project by the end of the year.
